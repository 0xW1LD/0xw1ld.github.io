We can exploit an XSS vulnerability in the web app to gain an admin cookie, from which we can interact with the blockhain api to leak credentials. We can then use these credentials to login to the system. We have permissions to run forge as another user. Using this privillege we run forge with a malicious build script to gain a shell as that user. This user has access to run pacman as root so we use this to install a malicious pacman package to get the ssh keys of root.</p><img src="https://labs.hackthebox.com/storage/avatars/a6165b53a2df41fbfd6530782224925f.png" style="float: right; width: 23%;">

            <p style="text-align: justify; width: 75%; float: left;">Chemistry is running an http webserver on a strange port, port 5000. The webpage is of a chemistry CIF analyzer tool using python. The python libraries that it uses in order to parse the CIF files is vulnerable to an RCE vulnerability. Using this we can upload and execute a reverse shell to get a shell on the system. We can then find a database with users and their passwords. One of the passwords belongs to a user on the machine allowing us to ssh into the machine. As User we find a monitoring site running as root on port 8080 which is running aiohttp with a vulnerable setting that allows for an LFI. We can use this LFI to gain root's ssh keys and ssh into the box.</p><img src="https://labs.hackthebox.com/storage/avatars/b8f3d660af2d3ed0929eb119e33526cf.png" style="float: right; width: 23%;">

            <p style="text-align: justify; width: 75%; float: left;">Yummy is running a website for booking a restaurant. The site allows us to download an iCalendar file, the endpoint of which is vulnerable to an LFI. Using this we're able to download the web files and spot a vulnerability with accessing the Admin dashboard. The dashboard is vulnerable to SQLi which gives us an Arbitrary file write vulnerability. Mixing this with the crontab information we're able to get a shell on the box.</p><img src="https://labs.hackthebox.com/storage/avatars/5ca57613886666c4c33ef23876b3f054.png" style="float: right; width: 23%;">

            <hr style="width:100%; background: #373c3e;">
            <p style="text-align: justify; width: 75%; float: left;">DarkCorp is running a roundcube mail service which is vulnerable to XSS which allows us to read user's mail. We use this to reset a password on a dashboard which is vulnerable to SQLi with RCE which we use to gain a shell. We find postgres backups which contain credentials for an ldap user and a user on the mail server. Using these credentials we can access webpage running on wev-01 which we can coerce to send an http request to a port on the mail server. We can relay this request to ntlmrelay using it to setup a malicious DNS record. We then coerce the Administrator to authenticate to this DNS record and gain Administrator on the web-01 server. After which we dump DPAPI credentials, we find a cleartext password which we can password spray against DC-01 and find another ldap user who can get us the hash of yet another user who has an admin account. Changing the UPN of that user to the one of the admin account allows us to abuse KRB5 on the mail server where we can find cashed credential hashes. The credentials belong to a GPO manager which we use to create an account in the local administrators to get control over the DC.</p><img src="https://labs.hackthebox.com/storage/avatars/93fba06a4780b65be5a5a4f9512b8e78.png" style="float: right; width: 23%;">

            <hr style="width:100%; background: #373c3e;">
            <p style="text-align: justify; width: 75%; float: left;">Nibbles is running a nibble blog on port 80 which is hidden behind the nibbleblog directory. Through a directory fuzz we can find an admin panel and are able to login through guessing the admin password. The site is vulnerable to an authenticated file upload RCE which we use to get user shell on the box. After which we find a vulnerable privilege to run a shell script in a directory where we have write access which we can use to escalate to root.</p><img src="https://labs.hackthebox.com/storage/avatars/344a8f99e8f7dddfed764f791e2731df.png" style="float: right; width: 23%;">

            <hr style="width:100%; background: #373c3e;">
            <p style="text-align: justify; width: 75%; float: left;">Caption is running a caption portal on port 80 and a gitbucket instance on port 8080. In gitbucket we find credentials for margo which we can use to login. Several pages on this site are vulnerable to a stored XSS. Through this we are able to steal cookies. However, we are unable to access the downloads directory due to haproxy; so we must smuggle our request by upgrading to http 2 using h2smuggle. We can then access the downloads directory and find an arbitrary file read used on margo's ssh key. Finally we find the logservice and create a client that we can use to execute arbitrary commands as root.</p><img src="https://labs.hackthebox.com/storage/avatars/d3cb6edd2a219f122696655d0015b101.png" style="float: right; width: 23%;">
