            <p style="text-align: justify; width: 75%; float: left;">Checker is running Bookstack and TeamPass on ports 80 and 8080 respectively. Teampass has an SQLi where we can leak credentials which we can use to login. TeamPass contains a couple of credentials for ssh and bookstack. We login on BookStack and looking around we find interesting documentation. The version of bookstack is vulnerable to an LFI via SSRF which we can use to steal the OTP key for ssh. Logging into ssh we find that the user has super user privileges to a script that is used to check for a password leak. Reversing the binary we see that it accesses a shared memory address, using this we can inject malicious code to achieve root.</p><img src="https://labs.hackthebox.com/storage/avatars/afe87a33205a5ffd978c805aa93488a9.png" style="float: right; width: 23%;">

            <p style="text-align: justify; width: 75%; float: left;">Escape two is an assumed breach scenario where we start of as Rose. Rose is able to view an SMB share that contains excel files which contain additional credentials for SA. SA is a service account running mssql which we have access to xp_cmdline to get a foothold. With this foothold we can look around and find a file with a cleartext password which, when password spraying, leads us to Ryan's account. Ryan has an ACL to write owner the CA account, which is the Certificate Authority service. Using the CA service we find a vulnerable certificate template that needs a slight edit for the ESC to work. Once we edit and exploit the template we're able to grab the Administrator's certificates and just like that we have root!</p><img src="https://labs.hackthebox.com/storage/avatars/d5fcf2425893a73cf137284e2de580e1.png" style="float: right; width: 23%;">

            <p style="text-align: justify; width: 75%; float: left;">Heal is running a resume builder website running Ruby on Rails as an api. We can abuse an LFI to gather credentials for another subdomain, Lime Survey. We can use these credentials to conduct an authenticated RCE which gets us a foothold. We use this foothold to locate databse credentials which we discover is the reused password of a user on the box. After which we can find a consul service running as root using a version with an RCE which we can use to escalate privileges.</p><img src="https://labs.hackthebox.com/storage/avatars/dcd5ef09ab764228c64385374ac744c1.png" style="float: right; width: 23%;">

            <p style="text-align: justify; width: 75%; float: left;">Underpass is running a default apache website. If we check udp ports we find that a daloradius is running. Looking through the source of daloradius we find a couple of login pages and default credentials. Using these credentials we login to a dashboard and find credentials for svcMosh. We use his credentials to ssh on the box. svcMosh can run Mosh-server as root which we can use to spawn a root terminal.</p><img src="https://labs.hackthebox.com/storage/avatars/456a4d2e52f182847fb0a2dba0420a44.png" style="float: right; width: 23%;">

            <p style="text-align: justify; width: 75%; float: left;">Bigbang is running a wordpress website using buddy forms which is vulnerable to RCE through image deserialization. Using this RCE we can establish a reverse shell which allows us to find credentials within a database with a reused password for ssh. We find a GrafanaDB endpoint which contains further credentials to pivot to another user. Finally we find an interesting thick web app running as root which is vulnerable to command injection.</p><img src="https://labs.hackthebox.com/storage/avatars/2d22afd496c5ae6f6c51ca24bf3719e1.png" style="float: right; width: 23%;">

            <p style="text-align: justify; width: 75%; float: left;">Vintage is another assumed breach active directory box, we're given Olivia's credentials. We use these to enumerate the domain using bloodhound where we'll find a pre 2000 compatible windows machine. We login using the machine account which can read GMSA01 which is another machine account. We use this account to allow ourselves to AS-REP Roast one of the service accounts. After which we find that the password is reused by C.Neri through a password spray. Checking bloodhound, C.Neri has an admin account which we manually have to decrypt the dpapi to read the password. C.Neri has access to the delegated admins group so we add SVC_SQL and give it an SPN using which we can impersonate L.Bianchi.adm who is root.</p><img src="https://labs.hackthebox.com/storage/avatars/4eae732c7af0ce1b443d009637167610.png" style="float: right; width: 23%;">

            <p style="text-align: justify; width: 75%; float: left;">Administrator is running Active Directory and we're provided with initial credentials for the user Olivia. We can use Olivia to change Michael's password who can change Benjamin's Password. Benjamin is a member of Share Moderators which hints us towards file shares, nothing interesting in SMB however FTP is open and is hosting a backup passwordsafe file. Cracking this file we gain access to Emily through her password located in the file. Emily can write Ethan, however we can't Kerberoast him so instead we ASREPRoast him. Ethan has DCsync privileges over the domain so we use those to dump all the hashes</p><img src="https://labs.hackthebox.com/storage/avatars/9d232b1558b7543c7cb85f2774687363.png" style="float: right; width: 23%;">

            <p style="text-align: justify; width: 75%; float: left;">Link vortex is running a webserver using ghost cms which we can find the credentials of in the git repository of a subdomain. We utilize a ghost cms exploit that uses symlinks to read files for the configuration of ghost which nets us the credentials of user Bob. Bob has the permissions to run a custom script as sudo which reads and transfers symlinks with some filtering. We can bypass the filtering through a double symlink. Another way we can escalate privileges is through exploiting a vulnerbility in the script that allows code execution through injection via the CHECK_CONTENT variable. Neither of these methods are intended and the intended method is to just fight the race condition right after the symlink is moved but before it is read to get another arbitrary file read.</p><img src="https://labs.hackthebox.com/storage/avatars/97f12db8fafed028448e29e30be7efac.png" style="float: right; width: 23%;">

            <p style="text-align: justify; width: 75%; float: left;">Blockblock is running an online web chat decentralized through block chain. We can exploit an XSS vulnerability in the web app to gain an admin cookie, from which we can interact with the blockhain api to leak credentials. We can then use these credentials to login to the system. We have permissions to run forge as another user. Using this privillege we run forge with a malicious build script to gain a shell as that user. This user has access to run pacman as root so we use this to install a malicious pacman package to get the ssh keys of root.</p><img src="https://labs.hackthebox.com/storage/avatars/a6165b53a2df41fbfd6530782224925f.png" style="float: right; width: 23%;">

The python libraries that it uses in order to parse the CIF files is vulnerable to an RCE vulnerability. Using this we can upload and execute a reverse shell to get a shell on the system. We can then find a database with users and their passwords. One of the passwords belongs to a user on the machine allowing us to ssh into the machine. As User we find a monitoring site running as root on port 8080 which is running aiohttp with a vulnerable setting that allows for an LFI. We can use this LFI to gain root's ssh keys and ssh into the box.</p><img src="https://labs.hackthebox.com/storage/avatars/b8f3d660af2d3ed0929eb119e33526cf.png" style="float: right; width: 23%;">

The site allows us to download an iCalendar file, the endpoint of which is vulnerable to an LFI. Using this we're able to download the web files and spot a vulnerability with accessing the Admin dashboard. The dashboard is vulnerable to SQLi which gives us an Arbitrary file write vulnerability. Mixing this with the crontab information we're able to get a shell on the box.</p><img src="https://labs.hackthebox.com/storage/avatars/5ca57613886666c4c33ef23876b3f054.png" style="float: right; width: 23%;">

Through a directory fuzz we can find an admin panel and are able to login through guessing the admin password. The site is vulnerable to an authenticated file upload RCE which we use to get user shell on the box. After which we find a vulnerable privilege to run a shell script in a directory where we have write access which we can use to escalate to root.</p><img src="https://labs.hackthebox.com/storage/avatars/344a8f99e8f7dddfed764f791e2731df.png" style="float: right; width: 23%;">

In gitbucket we find credentials for margo which we can use to login. Several pages on this site are vulnerable to a stored XSS. Through this we are able to steal cookies. However, we are unable to access the downloads directory due to haproxy; so we must smuggle our request by upgrading to http 2 using h2smuggle. We can then access the downloads directory and find an arbitrary file read used on margo's ssh key. Finally we find the logservice and create a client that we can use to execute arbitrary commands as root.</p><img src="https://labs.hackthebox.com/storage/avatars/d3cb6edd2a219f122696655d0015b101.png" style="float: right; width: 23%;">
